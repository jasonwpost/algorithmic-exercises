# Trick is to model this like a bipartitle graph with network flow

# We first build the graph with the database provided - the difficulties and
# topics avaiable serve as nodes, while the edge capacities serve as the number
# of questions availble at that difficulty - i.e. hard - math might have a 
# capacity of 2. 

# we then set sources and sinks from the intial information - i.e. if 2 easy,
# 1 medium, 1 hard is specified, the easy, medium and hard sources will be
# set as such, and the sinks wil be set the same way. If these set in a way
# that the graph doesn't support, we return No, otherwise we carry onto the
# FF Algorithm to find if an assignment is possible. If so, return Yes, else
# we return no.
